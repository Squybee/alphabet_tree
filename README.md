## Alphabet tree
1. Write a class that creates an AlphabetTree of any size or length.Add a method to the
class which accepts another alphabet tree, compares the data of the two trees and prints
all the unique letters within the two trees, in alphabetical order.
2. Write unit tests for the code.

I ended up not printing the values inside of the comparison method, as it made tests more complicated, and returned the value instead (to be printed in main);
